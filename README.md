**JPacmanQLearning**
==========

**By Jordi Smit**
This repository changes the [ jpacman-framework](https://github.com/SERG-Delft/jpacman-framework) of Arie van Deursen into a reinforcement learning enviroment. The main aim of this repository is to give a visual indication of how reinforcement learning works inside a maze.

## Controls
The enviroment has a GUI with the following control buttons:

 - The 'start' button activates the agent;
 - The 'stop' button freezes the agent;
 - The 'train max speed' button trains the agent at a much heigher speed;
 - The 'toggle training' button toggle the agents desicion making between eps-greedy and greedy;

## Demo:
The demo shows how the GUI can be used and how the environment can easily be changed using text files:
